                <p>I took time off school in spring 2021 to learn how to build things. What I'm most proud of:</p>

                                <p>A native app to help people who want to eat less meat find meatless dishes near them. It was my first time working with webscraping, natural language processing, MongoDB, Figma components, and Flutter. It took me a few months to get it functional, but I definitely learned a lot!</p>

                                <p>A hackathon project for Asian American community members to report crimes and request help for everyday tasks. It was meant to serve as a tool to enhance safety and connectivity in communities.</p>

                            <p>My latest pandemic obsession! I started with making little charms, and now I'm working on all sorts of beaded bracelets. Maybe eventually I'll make a jacket out of knots??</p>

                                <p>A super quick recipe for a refreshing and light dessert/snack. These are so tasty and easy to eat that I can eat all eight of the shortcakes this recipe makes in a couple hours!

                            <p>The most decadent brownies youâ€™ve ever tasted!! I like to make these at the beginning of the week and leave them around to snack on. What makes them so consistently good is actually the use of <strong>only</strong> cocoa powder and no chocolate. This is because without the variable fat and sugar content of chocolate, you can better control the proportions of both in the recipe. 
                            </p>

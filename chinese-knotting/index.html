            <h1>Chinese knotting</h1>
            <p>Chinese knotting has been around for thousands of years! The earliest known instance of knotting for accessorization is a shell 
                necklace from about 20,000 years ago during the New Stone Age. In the following millenia the royal palace drove innovation in 
                knot-making by housing and supporting artisans who practiced the craft.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The use of Chinese knots in everyday items, however, didnâ€™t become popularized until the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). During this time, 
                knots were used in everything from chairs to wall art to hair pins! In spring of 2021, my sister and I decided that Chinese knots 
                were cool and began to learn the craft as a bonding activity.

                    <h2>Tools to get started</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cork/foam board or other surface to stab pins into to keep the knot in place as you work</li>
                        <li>Synthetic fiber/silk string. Amazon has a lot of good options!</li>
                        <li>Fire. I don't have a lighter so I use my stove. This is to seal the ends of your knot. To seal, hold your ends near the flame. NOT IN. 
                            IT WILL BURN</li>
                        <li>Pins. Lots of pins. More pins than you'd expect. I like the ones that are long with little spheres on the blunt ends.</li>

            <p>Chinese knotting has been around for thousands of years! The earliest known instance of knotting for accessorization is a shell 
                necklace from about 20,000 years ago during the New Stone Age. In the following millenia the royal palace drove innovation in 
                knot-making by housing and supporting artisans who practiced the craft.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>The use of Chinese knots in everyday items, however, didnâ€™t become popularized until the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). During this time, 
                knots were used in everything from chairs to wall art to hair pins! In spring of 2021, my sister and I decided that Chinese knots 
                were cool and began to learn the craft as a bonding activity.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cork/foam board or other surface to stab pins into to keep the knot in place as you work</li>
                        <li>Synthetic fiber/silk string. Amazon has a lot of good options!</li>
                        <li>Fire. I don't have a lighter so I use my stove. This is to seal the ends of your knot. To seal, hold your ends near the flame. NOT IN. 
                            IT WILL BURN</li>
                        <li>Pins. Lots of pins. More pins than you'd expect. I like the ones that are long with little spheres on the blunt ends.</li>
                        <li>A needle and thread for sewing knots together. Otherwise, they don't keep their shape.</li>
                        <li>(optional) A <a class='small-link' href='https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Knotting-Illustrated-Guide-Projects/dp/160220019X#:~:text=Chinese%20Knotting%3A%20An%20Illustrated%20Guide%20to%20100%2B%20Projects%20is%20a,dating%20back%20to%20prehistoric%20times.'>knotting book</a>! Tutorials on Youtube are great, but it's also nice to have a physical guide with steps to follow</li>

                <h2>Building the frontend with React</h2>
                <p>Getting started on this project was probably the hardest part for me. Even though I had taken intro to coding at school, actually making something 
                    was a lot more daunting than writing algorithms and solving pset problems with code. I had no idea how to set up my development environment or do 
                    anything practical. Additionally, I had also only been learning React for two weeks at this point, and wasn't very familiar with the framework.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After lots and lots of Googling and some help from some of the mentors at my first hackathon, I managed to install everything I needed and find 
                    React tutorials that helped strengthen my understanding of the framework. A week later, I had a working timer and to-do list.
                </p>

                <h2>Using websockets and Node.js to implement rooms</h2>
                <p>To make Pomodoer different from websites and apps that are currently available, I set up rooms using websockets, specifically Socket.io. To set up websockets, 
                    I also needed a server and I decided on using Node.js because it seemed like the most popular one. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The hardest part of integrating the server with my frontend was syncing the frontend for all users in the same room. To do so, I had to move all of the 
                   calculations and storage that I was doing in my React app to a database on the server. This way, when someone new joined a room all I had to do was find 
                   the information associated with that room and send it to their browser. Although having a database hosted on my server isn't sustainable (because if the 
                   server goes down I lose all my data), I decided to move on because I wanted to work on other projects.

I also found during some initial chats that people (even those who wanted to change their diets) tended to have aversion to the word “vegetarian” because they felt that it implied commitment or exclusivity.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p class='summary-header'>How the scraper works:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Launch Puppeteer (headless browser).</li>
                        <li> Navigate to DoorDash's website.</li>
                        <li> Click into every food category and scroll down to scrape links until you can’t scroll anymore.</li>
                        <li> Remove duplicate links.</li>
                        <li> Navigate to each link and click into each dish one by one to scrape its name, images, description, and ordering requirements. Write this information to a MongoDB database.</li>
                    
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>I scraped DoorDash for restaurant information because a lot of restaurants had moved onto the platform during the pandemic, and 
                    it’s also the most widely used food delivery app in the US. It was a bit difficult to get started because DoorDash 
                    has a dynamic website (html/css for the site are changed by code running in the browser/on the server), and the tutorial
                     I had watched was for scraping static sites, but I eventually discovered that I needed to use a headless browser (Puppeteer)
                      to mimic human interaction with the site. Using a headless browser, I could imitate actions like clicking on things, typing, scrolling, waiting for elements to 
                      load, and running code in the browser console. </p>
                      <br>
                <p> Another big issue I ran into was with selecting the elements I wanted to interact with. When I first tried to run my code that targeted
                    the website's gibberish class names, I found that DoorDash an anti-scraping measure in place that scrambled class names when it sensed scraping. 
                    This made the whole process more tedious because for every element I wanted to interact with, I had to <strong>a)</strong> 
                    find distinctive features that I could select for, or <strong>b)</strong> find a distinctive neighbor/parent/child and 
                    traverse the DOM. Unfortunately, because I had to do it this way, my current scraper would fall apart as soon as any DoorDash 
                    engineer decides to add or remove a div from their element tree (which actually did happen while I was scraping).</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a few weeks, I ended up with a database of 1,100+ restaurants and 60,000+ dishes, all ready to be classified.</p>

                    <p class='summary-header'>TL;DR</p>
                    <p>I tried and it wasn't as good as my brute force algorithm :(( The brute force algorithm works like this:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check if a dish's name or description contains a meat word. If yes, it's <strong>not vegetarian</strong>. If yes, but it also has a word like "impossible" or 
                            "beyond", go to step two. If no, go to step two.</li>
                        <li>Check if the requirements can be fulfilled with vegetarian options. If yes, it's <strong>vegetarian</strong>. If no, it's <strong>not vegetarian</strong>.</li>    
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>I did some initial Googling and discovered that the kind of problem I wanted to solve was called a binary classification problem. 
                I wanted an algorithm that took in the name, description, and requirements of a dish and returned whether or not it was vegetarian. 
                Before I could even get started with models, however, I had to prepare my training and testing data. I created strings for 2,500 
                dishes consisting of their name, description, and requirements, before labelling and spliting them into testing and training sets 
                (20/80, based on the Pareto principle).</p>
                <br>
                <p>I then trained and tested logistic regression models, neural networks, and Bayes classifiers. 
                Immediately, I was able to rule out the Bayes classifier because its results were only 10% better than guessing. I'm not sure why, 
                but I think it may be because the Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence of the features (in this case, words), of an instance (dish string), 
                which did not hold for this case. The other two models were slightly underperformed my brute force algorithm in terms of accuracy 
                given a dish was vegetarian and overall accuracy, and to make sure they would underperform consistently I trained 100 more of each 
                model on different 20/80 divisions of data and calculated the average result.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p class='summary-header'>How the scraper works:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Launch Puppeteer (headless browser).</li>
                        <li> Navigate to DoorDash's website.</li>
                        <li> Click into every food category and scroll down to scrape links until you can’t scroll anymore.</li>
                        <li> Remove duplicate links.</li>
                        <li> Navigate to each link and click into each dish one by one to scrape its name, images, description, and ordering requirements. Write this information to a MongoDB database.</li>
                    
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>I scraped DoorDash for restaurant information because a lot of restaurants had moved onto the platform during the pandemic, and 
                    it’s also the most widely used food delivery app in the US. It was a bit difficult to get started because DoorDash 
                    has a dynamic website (html/css for the site are changed by code running in the browser/on the server), and the tutorial
                     I had watched was for scraping static sites, but I eventually discovered that I needed to use a headless browser (Puppeteer)
                      to mimic human interaction with the site. Using a headless browser, I could imitate actions like clicking on things, typing, scrolling, waiting for elements to 
                      load, and running code in the browser console. </p>
                      <br>
                <p> Another big issue I ran into was with selecting the elements I wanted to interact with. When I first tried to run my code that targeted
                    the website's gibberish class names, I found that DoorDash an anti-scraping measure in place that scrambled class names when it sensed scraping. 
                    This made the whole process more tedious because for every element I wanted to interact with, I had to <strong>a)</strong> 
                    find distinctive features that I could select for, or <strong>b)</strong> find a distinctive neighbor/parent/child and 
                    traverse the DOM. Unfortunately, because I had to do it this way, my current scraper would fall apart as soon as any DoorDash 
                    engineer decides to add or remove a div from their element tree (which actually did happen while I was scraping).</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a few weeks, I ended up with a database of 1,100+ restaurants and 60,000+ dishes, all ready to be classified.</p>

                    <p class='summary-header'>TL;DR</p>
                    <p>I tried and using ML classifiers and they weren't as good as my brute force algorithm :(( The brute force algorithm works like this:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check if a dish's name or description contains a meat word. If yes, it's <strong>not vegetarian</strong>. If yes, but it also has a word like "impossible" or 
                            "beyond", go to step two. If no, go to step two.</li>
                        <li>Check if the requirements can be fulfilled with vegetarian options. If yes, it's <strong>vegetarian</strong>. If no, it's <strong>not vegetarian</strong>.</li>    
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>I did some initial Googling and discovered that the kind of problem I wanted to solve was called a binary classification problem. 
                I wanted an algorithm that took in the name, description, and requirements of a dish and returned whether or not it was vegetarian. 
                Before I could even get started with models, however, I had to prepare my training and testing data. I created strings for 2,500 
                dishes consisting of their name, description, and requirements, before labelling and spliting them into testing and training sets 
                (20/80, based on the Pareto principle).</p>
                <br>
                <p>I then trained and tested logistic regression models, neural networks, and Bayes classifiers. 
                Immediately, I was able to rule out the Bayes classifier because its results were only 10% better than guessing. I'm not sure why, 
                but I think it may be because the Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence of the features (in this case, words), of an instance (dish string), 
                which did not hold for this case. The other two models were slightly underperformed my brute force algorithm in terms of accuracy 
                given a dish was vegetarian and overall accuracy, and to make sure they would underperform consistently I trained 100 more of each 
                model on different 20/80 divisions of data and calculated the average result.</p>

                <h2>
                    Learning Flutter and developing my app!!
                </h2>
                <p>I decided to learn Flutter because I wanted my final app to run natively on iOS, Android, and the browser. I also wanted to see if my 
                    experience with React would translate to other frontend frameworks. To my delight, it did! Flutter also has stateful and stateless class 
                    components, the ability to set states and initiate re-renders, and built-in elements called widgets. Each kind of widget has its own specific 
                    attributes (like an IconButton widget has a icon attribute to specify which icon you want to make into a button) that can be set when it's called.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It was cool that Flutter had so many pre-built abstractions over 
                    their simpler elements for developers to use (e.g. they have a horizontal line divider that's just a thin container element that you can set the height, width, and color of). 
                    It felt like using React + React-Bootstrap on steroids.</p>

                <p>I'm really proud that the current version of meatless is both responsive and adaptive! This means that it has layouts that change size depending on the screen size of a device and also
                deals with the different inputs and expectations that come with different types of devices. For example, the number of restaurant cards in a row changes with 
                the screen width, and once the screen is less than 500 pixels wide, it changes to a mobile interface with lower visual density and a one column list instead of a grid. 
                Doing this required a lot of extra design and coding work, but I'm glad I did it! I was able to learn a lot more about Flutter and 
                make an app that looks good on multiple device types as a result.</p>

                    <p class='summary-header'>Major changes from prototype to app:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The pin icons were too busy-looking, so I changed them to stars.</li>
                        <li>I realized that infinite scroll didn't make much sense for my use-case, so I made the restaurants and dishes displays paginated.</li>
                        <li>Returning restaurants near an address was pretty difficult since I didn't have latitude or longitude information, so I made it so that you could enter a zipcode and find restaurants in that zipcode instead.</li>
                        <li>Since all of my friends had been really attracted to the photos during the UI testing phase, I added photos to the restaurant cards on the restaurants page.</li>
                        <li>I got rid of features that require users to be useful (reviews, ratings).</li>

                    Mistakes I made (and learned from)
                </h2>
                
                   <p>For a good part of this process, I was setting goals that would've only been doable if nothing I had built before broke, or if nothing new came up during the week. This meant 
                        that when I had to do something urgently that wasn't a part of my goals for the week, I would get really stressed. 
                   </p>

                   <div class='summary'>
                       <p class='summary-header'>What I learned: </p>
                       <p>It's helpful for me to make two sets of weekly goals--what I want to get done in seven days and what I think I can get done in four days--and be okay with only completing the latter.</p>
                       <br>
                   </div>
                    <p>I made about 90% of my Figma prototype rectangle by rectangle, text box by text box, no re-usable components, no layouts. In retrospect, I probably 
                        should've realized something was wrong when I spent a day just adjusting the margins pixel by pixel on all 50 of my dish cards, but hey, hindsight is 20/20.

                    <div class='summary'>
                        <p class='summary-header'>What I learned: </p>
                        <p>If it feels like a tool to make something easier exists, it probably does and it can't hurt to do some quick Googling/documentation reading 
                            to look for it.</p>
                            <br>
                    </div>
                    <p>I actually had to scrape the exact same content from DoorDash twice because the first time I only scraped the names, descriptions, 
                        and requirements of dishes. I did this because I only wanted to scrape enough examples to create my training and testing data for 
                        the ML phase, but this really back-fired on me because I 1) didn't have the information I needed for the app and 2) couldn't even 
                        use the information I had to find the information I needed (restaurant information, dish images, etc). </p>
                    <div class='summary'>
                        <p class='summary-header'>What I learned: </p>
                        <p>You can never 
                            have too much data! Even if it's not structured efficiently in your database, you can always run a migration later. You can't 
                            re-structure information you don't have.</p>
                            <br>
                    </div>
                    <p>I made all of my Flutter components rely on each other for passing around information, specifically the starred status of dishes.
                        While this might be fine for mobile apps, I realized this was an issue when I tried to route my web-app and found that components kept erroring 
                        because when I routed to a new URL, they weren't able to inherit states from other components.</p>
                    <div class='summary'>
                        <p class='summary-header'>What I learned: </p>
                        <p>For web-apps, it's probably 
                            a good idea to pass information that needs to go to components at different URLs through the backend. This way, when a page re-loads, my components don't lose 
                            their state because it's not all on the browser.</p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <p>Next, I'd like to implement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>local storage or accounts so that people can keep track of their reviews and reports</li>
                <li>ability to upload photos with reviews</li>
                <li>some solve for the fact that the web version is laggy because the images I scraped from DoorDash are too large</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even though there are still some bugs, I'm really happy with what I was able to do in a few months. I'm really thankful for everything 
                I've learned about coding and about myself during this process, and it feels like I've become a better engineer along the way :))</p>
